# Steps to use this webshell
```
1) Hack the site admin panel or look for site with upload option (for uploading pics, images, etc) 
2) Look for upload section 
3) First try to upload the Tuploader.php into the site
If the site restricts php files, and says only png, jpeg or jpg images allowed 
Then next step is for you to upload the payload-image.png or try some file upload bypass like tuploader.pHp, tuploader.phtml etc  


The payload-image.png is an injected code for the php file
So once the png image has been successfully uploaded
But if the payload-image doesnt work. Use some file upload bypass tricks

4) Copy the image/shell location
5) Open in a tab
6) Then once you see the uploader
7) Upload the main shell which is the ths1335.php 
8) Then you can use the shell.. 

Hahah, make sure you use with care!!
